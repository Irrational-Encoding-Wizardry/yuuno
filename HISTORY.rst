0.8.0 (Glastig Uaine)
---------------------

* Now I name my releases because I feel like it.
* Fixed color profile not included in PNGs by default. Do so by emitting an sRGB-chunk.
* Completed first version of Comm-Protocol for Yuuno-Kernels.
* Added progressbar to %encode-magic.
* Added support for R41+ alpha clips. (Also with R43+ AlphaOutputTuple support: vapoursynth/#362)
* Use %show for IPython. It will convert the clip to a PIL image. (Can also work for Alpha-Tuples pre R41).

0.7.0
-----

* Added support for clips with variable video formats
* Added support for zlib compression and ICCP-chunk on PNG outputter

0.6.0 (2017-07-24)
------------------

* `%runvpy` can now return the outputs of a vapoursynth-script (.vpy) as a dict.
* Settings of VapourSynth cores are now exposed as configuration variables
* [Misc] Extracted `%encode` and stuck it inside its own sub-package.

0.5.0 (2017-06-18)
------------------

Rewrite of the yuuno codebase to prepare for Yuuno 1.0.0-release.

* You don't have to do `%yuuno install` anymore.
* To configure settings while in your IPython-shell, use the %config-magic, which is available in any IPython installation.
* The minimum Python-version of Yuuno is Python 3.6. Make sure you are running this version when upgrading.
* Using `%unload_ext yuuno` you can now completely deactivate Yuuno on your notebook.
* The `%encode`-magic has become more robust now.
* There is a `%render`-magic now, which does everything %encode does but stores the output into a io.BytesIO.
* All interactive applications are now IPython-magics.
* %preview returns a Preview-object. By changing the clip-Attribute of these objects, you can change the clip without losing the frame number.

0.4.0 (2017-05-18)
------------------

* Allow `vapoursynth.VideoFrames` to be inline-rendered.
* Fixed incorrect aspect-ratio on all `ipywidget` based features.
* Add f-string parsing inside `%encode`. (Will fallback to regular string.format for Python < 3.6) [thanks for the idea @ðŸŽŒeXmendiC]
* Switched to Jinja2 Templates for Raw-HTML output
* Omit iCCP-chunk since apparently the csp has to be set manually by the user on media players. Of course it can be changed back at any time.

0.3.0 (2017-03-20)
------------------

* An ICCP-chunk is now sent along with the PNG. Currently the default is the 709-CSP ICC. Color-Managed browsers will honor this chunk.
* The variables `core` (referencing the current VS-Core) and `vs` (as a referece to the vapoursynth) will now be pushed to the user-namespace on Yuuno activation.
* `%yuuno install` is now the installation command
* `%yuuno version` shows the current version of yuuno
* `%yuuno help` shows the help for Yuuno.
* `%yuuno get` and `%yuuno set` can be used for configuring Yuuno.
* You have to use `%load_ext yuuno` for initiating yuuno now.
